# Bank Account Tests

This project builds on the original BankAccount repository: https://github.com/tigerbluejay/BankAccount, which demonstrates basic object-oriented principles like classes, exception handling, and encapsulation in a simple banking context. In this version, the core bank logic has been separated into a class library project, which now references the original BankAccount project for improved modularity. Minor enhancements include additional calls to MakeWithdrawal() and the introduction of a new xUnit test project. This test suite contains three unit tests: one to confirm the testing framework is set up correctly and two that verify exception handling for overdrafts and negative deposits. The goal is to illustrate how to structure and write basic unit tests for object-oriented C# code.
